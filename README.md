# customers_invitation

We want to invite any customer within 100km of our Dublin office (GPS coordinates 53.3381985, -6.2592576) for some food and drinks on us. Write a program that will read the full list of customers and output the names and user ids of matching customers (within 100km), sorted by user id (ascending).

## Usage
`CustomerSearch.sorted_customers_from_file_near_origin(file_path, 53.3381985, -6.2592576, 10, 'user_id')`
